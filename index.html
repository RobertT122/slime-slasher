      content="Slasher is a fast-paced reaction game with a “rock-paper-scissors” style mechanism. In Slime Slasher you race against the clock to select the right attack, if you hit, you get points! If you miss, you lose a life (be careful, you only have three!) Beat your high score, challenge your friends, and enjoy the sometimes frustrating experience of battling slimes.
      Slime Slasher is designed with a mobile-first layout and input for maximum comfort and readability. It uses vanilla js and canvas elements to create clean animations and responsive controls.
      The game also contains accessibility features for those who have red-green colorblindness, or those who just want a different look!"
