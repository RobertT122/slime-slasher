## Implementation Timeline


Here you will detail what you hope to get done each day for this project. It serves as a roadmap for the upcoming week. You'll have the following days to work on this project:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday Morning
It can be quite hard to estimate how long parts of your project might take. Don't worry if you end up straying from this timeline; the goal is to have a plan in place for what you'll do & in what order, and to have a tentative pace.

You should also be aware that presentations will be Thursday afternoon, and deploying your project to GitHub Pages or Heroku will take some time Thursday morning, so don't plan much for that morning.
